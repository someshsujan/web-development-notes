notes:
* css have a selector  to select which tag needs changes eg : body ,h1 etc 
* css also has a declaration block which contains the modifications of the tag
* css can use the selector to select the class starting with a dot(dot is important) and the rest is same
eg: .about-me-title {
    color: blue;
}
* selector can be used to pick the element using the id and starts with #
eg : #submit-button {
    background-color : red;
} 
* css can be used in the html directly without being written in a new file between <style></style> tag
